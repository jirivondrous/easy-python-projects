# Python Mini-Projects

A collection of simple Python projects I created while learning Python.  
These projects are beginner-friendly and are meant to practice Python basics like loops, conditionals, functions, lists, dictionaries, and user input.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** These are beginner-friendly practice projects — **not** production-ready applications.

## Projects

1. **Dice Rolling Game**  
   Roll two dice repeatedly until the user quits.

2. **Number Guessing Game**  
   Guess a number chosen by the computer; tracks attempts.

3. **Rock-Paper-Scissors (PvP)**  
   Two players choose rock, paper, or scissors; declares winner.

4. **Rock-Paper-Scissors (AI)**  
   Single-player vs computer with ASCII art.

5. **Password Generator**  
   Generates a random password based on user input (letters, numbers, symbols).

6. **Login & Signup System**  
   A simple login and signup system using a Python dictionary to store usernames and passwords.  
   ⚠️ **Note:** This project does *not* use password hashing or databases. It’s for learning authentication logic only, not real-world applications.

7. **Hangman (Simple)**  
   Guess letters to reveal a hidden word (basic version).

8. **Hangman (Enhanced)**  
   Complete hangman with lives, repeated guess checks, and ASCII art.

9. **Caesar Cipher**  
   Encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift (classic Caesar cipher).  
   ⚠️ **Note:** The Caesar cipher is a historic cipher and not secure for modern encryption. Included here for learning and practice only.
